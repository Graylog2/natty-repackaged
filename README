**Caution**

This is a fork of the natty library which was used for building Graylog 1.3. It is not in use anymore and kept only for historical (as in: still being able to build old Graylog version) purposes. No PRs will be merged, no issues will be worked on.

****************************

Natty is a natural language date parser written in Java.  Given a date
expression, natty will apply standard language recognition and translation
techniques to produce a list of corresponding dates with optional parse and
syntax information.
